## Purpose

The **Daily Facts App** aims to provide users with a daily dose of random trivia in a visually appealing and interactive way. It showcases:
- **Integration with RESTful APIs**
- **State management in Flutter** via Stateful Widgets
- **Asynchronous programming** with `Future` and `async/await`

---

## Features

- **Random Fact Display**: Fetch and display a random fact using the API.
- **Interactive UI**: Button to fetch a new fact.
- **Expandable Architecture**: Ready for additional features such as favorites, categories, and offline storage.

---

## Architecture

The app uses a simple **MVC-like pattern**:
1. **Model**: API response data is dynamically managed.
2. **View**: UI components include `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and widgets for displaying facts and fetching new data.
3. **Controller**: Handles user interactions (e.g., button press) and fetches data from the API.

## Codebase Structure

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart        # Entry point of the application
â”œâ”€â”€ home_screen.dart # Core logic and UI for displaying random facts
```

### Key Components

#### **1. Main.dart**
- Sets up the MaterialApp and routes for navigation.
- Launches the `HomeScreen`.

#### **2. HomeScreen**
- A `StatefulWidget` that manages the core functionality:
  - Displays the random fact.
  - Fetches new facts from the API when the button is pressed.
  - Updates the UI dynamically using `setState`.

#### **fetchData Function**
- Responsible for calling the API.
- Handles successful responses and errors gracefully.
- Updates the `randomFact` variable to trigger UI changes.
